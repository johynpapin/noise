   A MIDI message is made up of an eight-bit status byte which is generally followed by one or two data bytes.

   There are a number of different types of MIDI messages. At the highest level, MIDI messages are classified
   as being either Channel Messages or System Messages.

   Channel messages are those which apply to a specific
   Channel, and the Channel number is included in the status byte for these messages. System messages are not
   Channel specific, and no Channel number is indicated in their status bytes.

   Channel Messages may be further classified as being either Channel Voice Messages, or Mode Messages.
   Channel Voice Messages carry musical performance data, and these messages comprise most of the traffic in
   a typical MIDI data stream. Channel Mode messages affect the way a receiving instrument will respond to the
   Channel Voice messages.

   MIDI System Messages are classified as being System Common Messages, System Real Time Messages, or
   System Exclusive Messages. System Common messages are intended for all receivers in the system. System
   Real Time messages are used for synchronisation between clock-based MIDI components. System Exclusive
   messages include a Manufacturer's Identification (ID) code, and are used to transfer any number of data bytes
   in a format specified by the referenced manufacturer.
